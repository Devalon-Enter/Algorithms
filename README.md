# Algorithms
This is just a repository for different Algorithms and Mathmatical problems that I have tried so far.

## How to Start
To run this project on a machine, please follow these steps:
first install `node_modules`
```
npm install
```
After all the dependecies are installed to run a file, run this command in a terminal:
```
  npx ts-node src/[File that you try to run].ts
```

### Currently available algorithms
There are currently two algorithms that I've fully explored. Not down to the full and completed math but a big chunk for each of them.
- [Calculate PI (Monte Carlo Algoritm)](/
- Percolation (Graph form)

## Monte Carlo Algorithm
This algorithm works as follows
